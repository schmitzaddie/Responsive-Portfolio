            <p>My name is Addie Schmitz. I am 23 years young! I graduated from Truman State University in 2017 with my
                Bachelor's in Justice Systems and a minor in Political Science. Several months after graduation, I was
                lucky enough to accept an internship in the Human Resources department of the National Association of
                Insurance Commissioners. Three months into my time with the company, I moved to a full-time position
                within the sister-company, the National Insurance Producer Registry. I have been a Business Analyst
                with NIPR for a year now and have loved every minute being immersed in an agile software development
                team.</p>
            <p>When I am not at work or at my University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp class, I can usually be found in one
                of three places; the gym, adventuring outdoors, or in my apartment painting.</p>
            <p>I drink a lot of coffee and watch a lot of How I Met Your Mother.</p>
